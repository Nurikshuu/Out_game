							as a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ark, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!dinosaurs, creatures, & breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry inventory and equipment such as armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! fly a pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging t-rex! take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. this process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! or put more simply, raise babies!you must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. all physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! by chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. all structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ark in a non-violent manner!by bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ark’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. these gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.create a tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your tribe. your tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. promote members to tribe admins to reduce the burden of management. distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!all items are crafted from blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. more remote and harsh locales across the ark tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! level-up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, level-up your tames, and learn new ""engrams"" to be able to craft items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. as you explore the vast ark, you'll find clues left by other survivors who have made the ark their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3d ""explorer notes"". by uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ark, and discover its purpose!everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!the mysterious ark is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. by fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. also to be found are explorer notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ark from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ark and its creatures. fully develop your in-game ark-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a compass or gps coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  and yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the creators and conquer the ark? a definitive end-game is planned.on the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. you can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ark's by accessing the obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the steam economy! a galaxy of arks, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official arks will be unveiled on the world-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!

ufo 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games from the creators of spelunky, downwell, and catacomb kids. explore a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and rpgs. our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.50 brand new games - these are not minigames or microgames! although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits. some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world adventures and a jrpg that could take many hours to beat.an alternate universe - according to the story of ufo 50, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity.an instant library - all 50 games are available to play at the start! the concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend's house and perusing their game library. jump in and out of games at a whim - exploring the collection is part of the fun!authentic but also modern - we carefully chose what elements to modernize. every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. on the other hand, it was important to us that ufo 50 was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.versus and co-op play - half of the collection features local multiplayer, including co-op and versus. you can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or strategy game... or team up to beat a classic arcade game from an alternate timeline. it's great for groups!here are some of games you'll get to play in ufo 50:campanella 2 - the sequel to campanella (another game in ufo 50), campanella 2 features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your ufo but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. you play as the intrepid treasure-hunter isabell, but she hasn't always been a hero - by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past.quibble race - in this unique sci-fi ""horse-racing"" game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. but your opponents can do the same, so the question is... how well can you anticipate their actions? up to 3 players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing.pingolf - a fan favorite at gaming get-togethers like pax, pingolf is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. as you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on!seaside drive - sometimes you'll want a break from long, open-world games and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style action game like seaside drive? but even in a popular genre, ufo 50 brings something new to the table - in this case, ojiro fumoto (the creator of downwell) designed a stylish car-based shoot 'em up where ""drifting"" across the screen is how you power-up your gun.grimstone - yes, there is a full blown jrpg in the collection! grimstone follows many conventions from 8-bit console rpgs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. the story takes place in the american wild west, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by hell! creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you'll be looking for answers as to why it happened.and that's just five games! out of 50! so come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! there's something for everyone!

RimWorld,"a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent ai storyteller. generates stories by simulating psychology, ecology, gunplay, melee combat, climate, biomes, diplomacy, interpersonal relationships, art, medicine, trade, and more. about this game
rimworld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent ai storyteller. inspired by dwarf fortress, firefly, and dune.you begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.trade with passing ships and caravans.form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.discover a new generated world each time you play.explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the steam workshop.learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive ai tutor.rimworld is a story generator. it’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. it works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the ai storyteller. there are several storytellers to choose from. randy random does crazy stuff, cassandra classic goes for rising tension, and phoebe chillax likes to relax.your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. you can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. you’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. so your colony will always be a motley crew.each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. a nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. a farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. a nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. a genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.the game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. you choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. these challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.travel across the planet. you're not stuck in one place. you can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. you can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. you can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.you can tame and train animals. lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. there are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.people in rimworld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. they respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. if they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. wounded legs slow people down. hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. and other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.you can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. a peg leg will get joe colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and joe becomes a superhuman runner. you can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.and there's much more than that! the game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. read more at http://rimworldgame.com.(all non-english translations are made by fans.)

Total War: WARHAMMER III - Shadows of Change,"about this content
							the shadows of change pack introduces 3 new legendary lords for tzeentch, grand cathay, and kislev, usable in both the realm of chaos and immortal empires campaigns. inject new legendary lords, heroes, and units into your games to vastly expand your methods of play on the campaign map and within battles. the changeling, yuan bo, and mother ostankya each bring their own unique campaign mechanics to their faction, with goals separate from the realm of chaos campaign, and new units to help them pursue victory on their terms.3 new legendary lords emerge from the shadows. perform dastardly schemes and trickery with the changeling of tzeentch. establish and execute grand stratagems on a global scale as yuan bo of grand cathay. conjure powerful hexes and incantations whilst engaging in witchcraft, flipping campaigns on their head as mother ostankya of kislev.  embrace change with 3 new legendary heroes. scatter magical spells at random with the blue scribes of tzeentch, field tzarina’s boldest champion with the golden knight of kislev, naryska leysa, and strike from afar with the sentinel of the heavens, saytang the watcher, for grand cathay.enact unsettling rituals with the lore of the hag; a new spell lore for mother ostankya and kislev.expand your rosters with 16 additional units, enhance your troops with 9 regiments of renown, and bolster your leadership with a new lord and hero for all 3 races. i make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. in the shadows, i bide my time. as a mighty horror of tzeentch, the changeling embodies the changer of ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. able to morph into any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, the changeling’s true form has been lost to time. his trickery may even deceive the dark gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork. the deceiving prankster of the known world, the changeling of tzeentch, was here. as a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the lore of tzeentch, the changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. when not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike. trust no one. the changeling’s inscrutable and random nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. for the changeling, the world is divided into theatres; segmented regions that contain schemes, both minor and pivotal. fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a theatre down through smaller, cheekier schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a grand scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way. gold, grimoires, and rifts aplenty.  with enough grand schemes carried out, the changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the ultimate scheme for campaign victory.  this troublesome legendary hero, the blue scribes, ride atop their disc of tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. if only they knew what those words meant... those in other nations may deny it, but all mortals desire control. to be controlled, that is. ruling over central cathay, yuan bo, the jade dragon leads the court of celestial sorcerers. a bureaucrat of the highest order on the surface, yes, but a talented spymaster at heart, the jade dragon runs the city of wei-jin and, by extension, is an administrator for the cathay empire. liked by all, the good of grand cathay is in capable hands.  serving two roles between his human and dragon forms, the jade dragon can be a devastating single target destroyer, and a potent spellcaster with the light, yin, and heaven lores of magic. soar above the battlefield as a dragon, burning down even the strongest of enemy units, or take the fight on the ground with game-changing spells at your side. cathay stands, all the same.  engage in a chess match unlike any other with the matters of state. as a master statesman, a right hand to the emperor and a spymaster, yuan bo’s influence over the kingdom runs deep. with this power, enact overt and covert policies across settlements, armies and even characters to best suit your empire’s needs. crack down on settlement corruption, rush construction for your entire empire in a single move, create diplomatic deadlocks to move freely through unfriendly territories, and much, much more. go beyond mere balance and embrace disharmony, leveraging it as an excuse to serve more severe and extreme actions to fit your agenda, and plan chains of actions to ensure the balance of harmony is pulled back in your favour when all is said and done.  yuan bo doesn’t follow the rules. he writes them. with a plan centuries in the making under the request of yuan bo’s father, the jade dragon is tasked with travelling to critical locations and constructing relays to empower the jade compass, before defending them from the lizardmen incursions trying to dismantle cathay. destroy them, and plot a course to victory.  for years we thought she was a child's tale to frighten us into behaving. then one day, in my twentieth winter, i got too close to the woods. and when i was told mother ostankya would get you... i knew if i took one step closer to the trees it would be true. tales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. mother ostankya is real. a guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. when war comes knocking, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them. and if you cross her path, make no mistake. mother ostankya will punish you. as a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, mother ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid.  the daughters of the forest must infuse mother ostankya’s witchcraft at the witch’s hut. with a new rare resource, spirit essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent incantations and utilise hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign.  force enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the malediction of ruin; mother ostankya’s final hex to secure the sanctity of kislevite land. welcome a world of change with new additional units for tzeentch, grand cathay, and kislev. field an abomination with the mutalith vortex beast for tzeentch, a horrific fusion of monster and magic, created by the powers of chaos beyond any justifiable reason. it brings raw, magical destruction to the table with violent spectacle. it won’t take a compass to find the new additions to the cathayan roster. crafted by the wizards of the celestial court, guardian lions are living statues made from jet or jade. for those seeking a magical touch, the jade lion is a sorcerer's conduit, able to use spells bound to its body and launch flaming attacks. the jet lion, however, is the opposite, countering magical spells to diminish any sorcery that may harm themselves or those nearby. plus, new kislevite units lurk in these woods. a terrible and frightening creature, known to many as the thing in the woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of kislev. left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again.  and, of course, further horrors await within the shadows of change.

Manor Lords,"manor lords is a medieval strategy game featuring in-depth city building, large-scale tactical battles, and complex economic and social simulations. rule your lands as a medieval lord – the seasons pass, the weather changes, and cities rise and fall. about this game
manor lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century franconia, manor lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.manor lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.from boots to barley and hides to honey, manor lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.  resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. at times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. when needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.this game is a passion project started by a solo developer. you can reach out to me and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms - i listen to your feedback.
